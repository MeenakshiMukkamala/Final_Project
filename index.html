			<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two-12 cup muffin pans or line with 
				20 paper baking cups.</li>
	<li>In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs, 
		buttermilk, red food coloring and vanilla. Stir in the baking soda and vinegar. Combine the flour, cocoa 
		powder and salt; stir into the batter just until blended. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, dividing evenly. </li>
	<li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan
	set over a wire rack. When cool, arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter and frost with desired frosting. </li>
